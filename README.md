# Hey, I'm Aaron - aka Kaxon

I'm a Java Software Engineer and recent Cybersecurity Engineering Graduate with experience developing professional, modular software.

## Current Focus

While I can't share too many details of current projects due to NDAs, I am always striving to deepen my knowledge and expertise across technologies. Some of the recent tools and technologies I have been working with include:

- Java and Kotlin ☕
- C# and .NET ©️
- Git and Docker 🐳
- Debian-based Linux distros 🐧
- MongoDB 🍃, Redis 🚀, and MySQL 🐬
