# Hi there, I'm Aaron - aka Kaxon! 👋

I'm a Java Software Engineer and recent Cybersecurity Engineering Graduate with experience developing professional, modular software in an Agile work environment.

## What I'm Working On

While I can't share too many details on GitHub about current projects due to NDAs, I can say their highly engaging nature regularly pushes me to deepen my knowledge and expertise across multiple technologies. For the past four years, I have been collaborating with others and using a range of modern tools, including, but not limited to:

- Java and Kotlin ☕
- C# and .NET ©️
- Git and Docker 🐳
- Debian-based Linux distros 🐧
- MongoDB 🍃, Redis 🚀, and MySQL 🐬

## How to Get in Touch

If you're interested in learning more about my understanding of these languages or my experiences of working on proprietary projects, please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly. You can [email me](mailto:aaron@kaxon.dev) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronbotto/).

Thanks for checking out my profile, and I look forward to connecting with you!
